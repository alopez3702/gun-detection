```

```
cd object_detection
```

For optimization, the object detection code has been split into two seperate scripts that can be run simulatenously, but should be run in seperate instances. Depending on which instance one is running, do the following:

```
cp /detect_pistol/person-camera-session-one.py .
```
or
```
cp /detect_pistol/person-camera-session-two.py .
```
then, for both:
```
wget http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/faster_rcnn_resnet101_coco_2017_11_08.tar.gz
```

```
tar -xvf faster_rcnn_resnet101_coco_2017_11_08.tar.gz
```
